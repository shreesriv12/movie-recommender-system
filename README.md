# Recommendation Systems

This repository contains implementations of Content-Based Filtering, Collaborative Filtering, and Hybrid Recommendation Systems. These methods are commonly used in applications such as e-commerce, streaming services, and social media platforms to suggest relevant items to users.

## Overview

A recommendation system suggests items to users based on their preferences, past behavior, and similarities with other users or items. This project explores three main techniques:

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends items similar to what a user has interacted with.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests items based on interactions of users with similar interests.
- **Hybrid Model**: Combines content-based and collaborative filtering for improved accuracy.

## Recommendation Techniques

### Content-Based Filtering

- Uses item attributes (e.g., genre, keywords, descriptions) to recommend similar items.
- Measures similarity using techniques like **TF-IDF, cosine similarity, and word embeddings**.
- Works well when sufficient metadata is available for items.

### Collaborative Filtering

- Uses past user interactions to find similarities among users or items.
- Two types:
  - **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Finds users with similar preferences.
  - **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends items that are frequently liked together.
- Common techniques include **KNN, Matrix Factorization (SVD, ALS), and Deep Learning models**.

### Hybrid Recommendation System

- Combines both content-based and collaborative filtering.
- Helps mitigate cold-start problems and improves recommendation diversity.
- **Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify** use hybrid models for better personalization.
